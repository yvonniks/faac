 * pseudo_sbr.h - Encoder-side Pseudo Spectral Band Replication for AAC-LC
 *
 * After the MDCT, the encoder's bandwidth limiter leaves the upper spectrum
 * empty at low bitrates.  Pseudo-SBR fills that gap by copying and
 * noise-dithering the top of the coded region, then extending sfbn so
 * BlocQuant will quantize the synthesised bins.
 *
 * This is a purely encoder-side technique: the output is a standard AAC-LC
 * bitstream requiring no decoder changes.
